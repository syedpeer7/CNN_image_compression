# Image Compression and Reconstruction using Autoencoder

This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Autoencoder built with TensorFlow and Keras that compresses and reconstructs grayscale images. The autoencoder learns a compact representation of the input images and attempts to reconstruct them as closely as possible.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Upload your own grayscale images manually via Google Colab
- Resize and normalize the images
- Train a convolutional autoencoder to learn compressed representations
- Visualize original and reconstructed images side-by-side

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
